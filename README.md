This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS styles are not consistently applied to elements, even with proper configuration and compilation. The `bug.html` file shows the HTML structure with Tailwind classes that aren't working as expected.  `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected CSS/Tailwind directives for resolving the issue. This inconsistency could stem from various sources including incorrect import order, conflicting CSS rules, or issues with the build process itself. The solution focuses on ensuring correct class usage, precedence, and Tailwind configuration.
