The problem was due to conflicting CSS rules from other stylesheets unintentionally overriding Tailwind's styles.  The solution involves ensuring that your Tailwind CSS styles are included *after* any other stylesheets or inline styles that might be interfering. To resolve the issue, I've added a `!important` flag to the conflicting styles to enforce correct precedence temporarily.  However, for a better long term solution, refactor the conflicting stylesheets to avoid the unnecessary overlap.  Additionally, make sure to use Tailwind's `@apply` directive judiciously to avoid unintended conflicts.
